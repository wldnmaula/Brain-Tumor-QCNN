2. Look for the latest release tag marked as **Latest Release**.
3. Click on the appropriate file for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux) to start the download.
4. Once the download finishes, locate the file in your downloads folder.
5. Double-click the file to run the application. Follow any on-screen prompts to complete the setup.

## ❓ How It Works 

Brain-Tumor-QCNN uses a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network. Here’s a simple breakdown of how it operates:

1. **Input MRI Images:** You supply MRI images of the brain.
2. **Feature Extraction:** The software uses EfficientNet-B0 to analyze the image.
3. **Quantum Processing:** A quantum layer processes features to enhance accuracy.
4. **Prediction:** Finally, you receive an output that indicates whether there is a tumor.

## 🖥️ System Requirements 

To ensure the software runs smoothly, please check that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.15 or later, or any recent version of Linux.
- **RAM:** At least 8 GB of RAM is recommended for best performance.
- **Processor:** A multi-core processor (i5 or similar) is preferred.
- **Disk Space:** At least 500 MB of free disk space for installation.

## 🌐 Usage Instructions 

After installation, follow these steps to use Brain-Tumor-QCNN:

1. Open the application to launch the Gradio-based interface.
2. Click on the button to upload your MRI image.
3. Once the image is uploaded, click the **Analyze** button.
4. The software will process the image and display results shortly.

## 📖 Features 

- **Automated Detection:** Quickly identifies potential tumors in MRI images.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, even for those with no technical experience.
- **Integration with Gradio:** Provides a straightforward way to interact with the application.
- **Quantum-Classical Hybrid:** Combines the strengths of both quantum computing and classical methods for improved accuracy.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting 

If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:

- **Application Won't Open:**
  - Ensure that you have the required system specifications.
  - Restart your computer and try again.

- **Image Uploading Problems:**
  - Make sure the MRI image is in a compatible format (JPEG, PNG).
  - Check that the file size does not exceed our limits.

- **Slow Processing:**
  - Close other applications to free up system resources.
  - Ensure you are using a system that meets the recommendations.
